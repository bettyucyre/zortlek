<p>Did your ban pop up the moment you created a fresh new account? Or is it stopping you from playing on multiple profiles? You might be <strong>HWID banned</strong> (Hardware ID Ban)! This fancy term means the system flagged your computer’s unique hardware ID, which makes getting around the ban a bit tricky, even if you try with a brand-new account.</p>
